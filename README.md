# OpenMPPageRank
A parallel PageRank program in OpenMP.
Task 1
Write a parallel PageRank program in OpenMP (please see Resources Part to find the requirement of input Web graph file). Assume that only one of the threads reads the file. The pagerank values are initialized to a normalized identity vector by all the threads, and then updated using a matrix vector product. The process continues until the page ranks do not change significantly (you should explicitly give the condition or threshold in your report).
